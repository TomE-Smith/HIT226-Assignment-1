<h1> What is a Living Style Guide? </h1>
<p> A LivingCSS style guide is a CSS (cascading style sheet) document that defines all elements of<br>
all the pages that comprise a website (Robertson 2014). These documents are considered <br>
<em>living</em>, because the coding inside these documents always apply themselves to <br>
any new added pages and/or HTML code changes (Haritonov 2015).</p>

<h2> Why is this important?</h2>
<p>Living style guides are deemed important for a few key reasons. For instance, these allow <br>
web-page coders to check if any part of their page design falters after having code changes <br>
 (Debenham 2011). Living style guides also allow project newcomers to know what styles to use <br>
 on any element of the page, as well as allowing the CSS file to remain small and quick to load <br>
 (Robertson 2014)</p>

<h1>How to use Living Style Guides</h1>
<p>Some basic tips for creating living style guides</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Start out by planning out the general structure of your current project via rough sketches <br>
     (where the logo sits, where bodys of text lie, where and how the navigation bar works, etc.). <br>
     (Debanham 2011)<br>
   </li>
   <br>
   <li> Debanham (2011) also writes that after planning the website, people should start defining how <br>
   the headers, tables and lists, links and bodies of text etc. appear on the page (such as text <br>
   alignment, colour, font style, etc.) </li>
   <br>
   <li></li>
   <br>
 </ul>
